# PNC Account Balance Widget

This is a simple widget I'm working on for displaying my current bank account balance on the Android home screen.

It isn't feature complete, and you have to edit the sourecode to configure it. One day there may be a configuration menu. Also, I haven't coded for edge cases, so it is really easy to break.

It is for personal use. I built it for me, because I needed it. If you feel like you need it to, feel free to contribute.
